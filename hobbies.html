                <h4>I discovered my passion for dance at age 8 and have been 
                    doing Ballet for 10 years. Besides being a great source of 
                    exercise, classical dance has taught me self-discipline and perseverance: 
                    that practicing the same pirouette over and over again until I get it right is very rewarding.</h4>

            <h3>Track and Field</h3>

                <h4>I joined the track and field team on a whim in high school 
                    after reading apocalyptic novels that made me want to improve my running ability. 
                    From this experience, Iâ€™ve begun to appreciate the mental game that comes with 
                    running cross-country and how difficult it can be just to carry on. 
                    The mission of self-improvement has stayed with me since.</h4>
